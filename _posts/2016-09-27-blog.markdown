<p>Due to Ghost being a piece of shit, including :</p>
<li>No ability to have comments</li>
<li>Upgrading taking more than 512 Mb of RAM</li>
<p><br />
Among others…
<br />
I have decided this time to give nibbleblog a try and i’m already loving it :</p>
<li>No use of MySQL (great against SQL injections)</li>
<li>Comments allowed without the use of Ghostery or Facebook</li>
<li>More lightweight than Ghost</li>
<p><br />
There’s a sucessor, bludit, but it doesn’t allow comments without the use of Disqus or some shit like that.
<br />
I have already pushed some security patches, making it more lightweight and i will continue to do so.</p>

<p>I hope i can repost my old articles as well…</p>
