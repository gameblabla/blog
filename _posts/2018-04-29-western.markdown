Again, it's been a while.
<br>
I did several things since then :
<br>
I have released a port of Evil Australians for the Atari Falcon.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunely i still have no idea if it works properly on real hardware....
<br>
But it works well on emulators.
<br>

<br>
The second project was one that took me a month (with plenty of breaks...).
<br>
It is my final Pebble game : Western Ideals. I had to scrap some plans
<br>
because Fitbit plans to shutdown servers next month... Oh well.
<br><br>
<a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5ae67e5bf38588775f0006cc?section=watchapps">It's available here on the Pebble app store.</a>

That's all for now, thank you.
