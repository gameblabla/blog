<b>So yeah</b>...

<p>I went from <b>Ghost</b> to <b>Nibbleblog</b>, then to <b>Bludit</b> and before settling with <b>Jekyll</b>.</p>

<p>The reason for all this mess is because i was looking for something that plays nice with restrictive CSP (Content Security Policy) rules.</p>

<p>… And it turns out only <b>Jekyll</b> fits the bill.</p>

<p>This has no WYSIWYG visual editor available however…
<br />
I think i’ll do without it.</p>

<p>But i’m not done yet !</p>

<p>I also had to manually convert my old Nibbleblog posts to Jekyll which was a very painful experience but it’s much nicer to the eyes.</p>

<p>Honestly, i did not understand why some people were bashing on WYSIWYG editors but now i can see why…</p>

<p>Simply put : 
<br />
You have more control on how your text should look like.<br />
As a result, you get the desired result.</p>

<p>Markup languages are also more reliable and you don’t get a random buggy mess that’s common with visual editors.</p>

<p>But anyway… you should see more posts from me !
<br />
What follows next is my review on some old Yu-Gi-Oh Games.</p>

<b>Enjoy !</b>
