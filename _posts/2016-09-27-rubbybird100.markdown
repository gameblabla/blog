I am proud to announce the release of Rubby Bird 100, 
<br />
the sequel to Rubby Bird !</p>

<p>You thought rubbing one bird was easy enough ?
<br />
Try with 100 birds instead !</p>

<p>The darker they become, the closer they are to death.
<br />
If you fail to keep alive with a certain amount of birds, itâ€™s game over !</p>

<p>Rubby Bird 100 is available for Android (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameblabla.rubbybird&amp;hl=en">Google Play Store</a>), Sailfish OS and browsers at <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/683859">Newgrounds</a> and <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/gameblabla/rubby-bird-100">Kongregate</a>.</p>
